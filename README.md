Visualization for algorithm executions on data structure
========================================================

2D/3D visualization of the algorithm execution on a data structure. The algorithm, the data structure, and the way to view the structure and the execution is specified by the user.

There is already an implementation for the view and placement on space for the data structure graph and array.
